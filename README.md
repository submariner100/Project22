Lessons Learnt - CoreLocation, CLLocationManager,CLBeaconRegion, locationManager()
This Application needs iOS7 or above and requires you to have an beacon application running. I have downloaded "Locate Beacon"
on device and it runs well.
The technology is often called micro-location because it can tell the difference a few centimeters and a meter or more.
